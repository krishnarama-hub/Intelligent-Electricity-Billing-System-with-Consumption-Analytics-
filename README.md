# Intelligent-Electricity-Billing-System-with-Consumption-Analytics-
Problem Definition: Develop a comprehensive electricity billing system that calculates bills, analyzes
consumption patterns, and implements smart pricing logic using computational thinking principles. Ap
ply logical reasoning, conditional programming, and systematic problem-solving approaches to solve the
proposed work. You can follow the computational thinking implementation as next:
• Decomposition: Breaking down the billing problem into smaller components
• Pattern Recognition: Identifying consumption patterns and categories
• Abstraction: Focus on significant components of the problem
• Algorithm Design: Designing step-by-step logical procedures for calculations
Task 1: Core Billing Calculation Engine
(a) Implement a tiered billing system with the following pricing structure:
• 0-100 Units: No charge (Free basic electricity)
• 101-200 Units: 5 per unit (only for units above 100)
• Above 200 Units: 10 per unit (for all units beyond 200)
Task 2: Detailed Bill Breakdown & Consumption Analytics
(b) Generate a comprehensive bill breakdown showing:
• Unit consumption in each tier (pricing slabs)
• Charges applied per tier
• Total amount before any adjustments
• Implement validation to ensure unit input is a positive number
(c) Intelligent Consumption Categorization with automated alerts:
• 0-150 Units: “Low Consumption- Eco-Friendly User”
• 151-200 Units: “Average Consumption- Moderate User”
• Above200Units: “HIGHCONSUMPTION-ENERGYEFFICIENCYALERT!”
Task 3: Smart Discount & Incentive System
(d) Implement conditional discount logic:
• Apply a 10%discount only for high consumption category users
• Display both original and discounted amounts
• Provide energy-saving recommendations based on consumption level
• Use if-elif-else reasoning for precise discount application
Task 4: Comparative Consumption Analysis
(e) Multi-user comparison system:
• Accept consumption data for two different users
• Compare their billing amounts and consumption patterns
• Identify and display the highest consumer with detailed comparison
• Generate insights: “User A consumes X% more than User B”
Task 5: Advanced Features 
• Seasonal Pricing: Implement different rates for summer vs. winter months
• Peak/Off-Peak Hours: Apply time-based pricing logic
• Predictive Alert System: Forecast next month’s bill based on current trends
• Energy Saving Tips: Provide customized recommendations based on usage patterns
